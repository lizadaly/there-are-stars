# There are stars: A story

A collaborative narrative told through Github and automation. An entry in [National Novel Generation Month 2022](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2022), which has now ended.

The story: https://lizadaly.github.io/there-are-stars/
## How to participate

Every time someone stars this repository, a new character joins the story. The story
is regenerated every 10 minutes.

The story code will use a hash of the username who starred the repository to generate a consistent random seed so each time the story re-generates, the characters and their attributes
remain the same. The story does not otherwise use any information about users
who interact with the repository.

If you have starred the repository and you un-star it, the character representing you
will disappear the next time the story is regenerated.
